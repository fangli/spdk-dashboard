# SPDK Dashboard

A fancy realtime dashboard for SPDK (Storage Performance Development Kit) storage metrics.

The charts in dashboard updates every second, giving you realtime monitoring experience.

* Include a fancy dark-mode web interface
* Realtime update
* Nearly ZERO impact on SPDK performance. Actually, we don't pull any metrics from SPDK if no one is watching the dashboard, and there's only one instance of fetcher will be executed even if there're 1000 browser window opened.
* Easy-peasy deployment. It just works out-of-the-box.

## Donate

## Metrics

The following metrics/statistics are included:

#### Block devices

* Read bytes per second
* Write bytes per second
* IO per second
* Latency ticks

#### Reactors

* Busy ticks per second
* Idle ticks per second

#### Connected NVMf Subsystem controllers

* All controllers that connected to the SPDK instance

## Build

There's a `build.sh` in the repo root. It's a simple bash script, please check it out for details.

## Install

ONLY A SINGLE binary is required to deploy this SPDK dashboard. Please either:

* Build the binary yourself
* Or download the pre-built binary from release page

And put the binary to wherever your SPDK storage server is running. All good to go.

## Usage

Execute the `spdk_dashboard`, the application will (by default):

* Listen 0.0.0.0:8000, so you should be able to open the WebUI dashboard on port 8000
* Fetch metrics from backend SPDK RPC `/var/tmp/spdk.sock`. This should be the default unix socket that SPDK listen to

If the web dashboard gets stuck at loading page, you should be able to see some error logs from output of `spdk_dashboard`.

```
root@spdk-server:/tmp# ./spdk_dashboard -h

Usage of ./spdk_dashboard:
  -http-listen string
        Which address and port should we listen to? This must be [address:port] (default "0.0.0.0:8000")
  -spdk-rpc string
        The SPDK RPC server. For example: /var/tmp/spdk.sock for unix socket, 127.0.0.1:1234 for TCP. (default "/var/tmp/spdk.sock")
```
